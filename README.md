# About

Adds crafting recipe for sling weapons from leather or cloth, to the leatherworkers shop and clothers workshop respectively. You can craft 'shot' ammo from the stoneworkers workshop from any stone or metal in stacks of 25, like bolts or arrows.

Bombard your enemies from afar with high velocity stone!

Available for All races except cave dwellers.

Doesn't yet display on the dwarves sprites when equipped, I will add that in the future.
